--EXPECT-OUTPUT--
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Installation request for a ~1.0 -> satisfiable by a[1.0.0].
    - a 1.0.0 requires php 5.5 -> your PHP version (%s) overridden by "config.platform.php" version (5.3) does not satisfy that requirement.
